## Mission
> Create a non-fungible token dapp for a token that no one wants to have, a cheese touch token. Allow only 1 token to be 'live' at a time. If there is no live token anyone can create one. Allow users to transfer the live token to anyone else. If any user holds a live token for more than 24 hours then they can no longer transfer it, and the token should no longer be live.
